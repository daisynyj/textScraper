The textScraper is a light weight tool to catch the information from the web page (www.shopping.com). According to the keywords user entered, it will return certain information.

There are two queries that will be performed: One is that, given a keyword, the textScraper will return the total number of results found. Besides, given the key work and a page number, it will return a couple of information of the searching result, including the title, the price, shipping price and the vendor of the commodity.

This project contains three classes. The commodityInfo, which is a class to describe the commodity, we can get or set data of a certain commodity. HtmlParser is the core class to implement the HTML page parsing. We picked up information we want through the parser library¡£ The test class includes a main method to executive the project.And the program will run by queries. To develop this project, I imported the jar library: "HtmlParser" which is a strong tool for people now to analyze and catch information from HTML file. 
The development environment is Java/Eclipse this time. The main technique I used is HTMLparser with its filter and nodes mechanism. I built URL according to the keywords user input and initialized a parser to parse the information. There is an ArrayList to store all the commodities showed on the current page. Two methods, hp.getItemNumber() and hp.getCommodityInfo() return the information corresponding to requirement.
